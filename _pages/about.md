I am an Associate Research Scientist at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health. My research and teaching expertise centers on the intersection of data science, public policy, and political communication with a
primary focus on energy and environmental policy.I am passionate about applying computational text analysis, social network analysis, and spatial analysis in my work. Currently, I am involved in projects funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, and the Climate Social Science Network (CSSN) at Brown University.

My sole-authored and coauthored publications appear in the Policy Studies Journal (PSJ), Energy Research & Social Science, Energy Strategy Reviews, Sustainable Development, Climatic Change, Frontiers in Sustainable Cities, Journal of Chinese Governance, and Chinese Public Administration Review. I received my PhD in Public Policy from Northeastern University (Boston) where I was advised by Dr. Jennie C. Stephens. In support of my dissertation work, I hold a Fall 2022 Experiential Fellowship from Northeastern’s College of Social Sciences and Humanities. My dissertation work was also partially funded by Northeastern University’s Transforming Interdisciplinary Experiential Research (TIER) 1 Seed Grant and a grant from CSSN.
